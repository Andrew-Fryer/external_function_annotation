\section{Introduction}
I should be able to grab this out of the propsocal.

\section{Design Process and Dead Ends}
I tried a bunch of stuff that didn't work.

\section{Final Solution Results}
This is what it is capable of...

\section{Limitations}
It can't do...

        rust code!

\section{Learning Outcomes}
If I have extra time, I will first work on including code from external libraries in the analysis.
I will likely add a parameter to the bash script that will indicate where to look for Rust libraries.
This will improve the analysis because it will be able to look through libraries all the way to \lstinline{extern} functions which are written in c and linked in.

The other stretch goal I have is to write more complex TXL rules that will build a table of all traits (similar to interfaces) and then use the table to track down trait method calls.
This will further imrpove the analysis because it will be able to analyze method calls on trait objects.
